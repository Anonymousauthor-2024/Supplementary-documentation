In the process of deriving themes, we first identified primary IT usage behaviors and safety perceptions among PWUD, analyzed their safety impacts, abstracted new safety challenges as broader phenomena, and then used these insights to answer our research questions.

We began by examining how PWUD utilize IT by directly asking participants when and how they use IT. For example, when a participant mentioned that they would ask questions on online forums before using a drug to ensure correct usage, we coded this behavior as *Asking Questions on Drug Use* and categorized it under the *Pre-usage stage*. To avoid missing any behaviors due to participants' difficulty in connecting to specific IT technologies, we expanded our identification scope to encompass the entire interview, rather than relying solely on responses to individual questions. Through these coding efforts, we summarized the framework of PWUD’s IT utilization as outlined in section 3.1.4.

We then established a definition of safety specific to PWUD by examining the aspects participants were most concerned about when discussing their drug use. For example, when a participant mentioned that they might discuss their drug use with close friends but would avoid sharing this information with colleagues, it indicated that social image was a crucial safety concern in their drug use experience. This was then coded as a concern related to *Social Image*. Similarly, when participants described the types of information they would seek out before using a new drug—such as potential acute reactions and how to manage them—we coded these concerns under the theme of *Acute Effect*.

Following this, we analyzed the impact of these behaviors on participants' safety whenever they mentioned engaging in these activities. Each behavior was further explored to understand its specific safety implications, resulting in sub-themes that addressed various dimensions. For example, when a participant described how information they found on harm reduction helped them adjust their dosage and frequency of use, thereby mitigating some negative effects, we coded this impact as *Supporting Health Awareness of Drug Use*.

During this analysis, we discovered that certain new safety challenges could not be easily linked to a single behavior but rather emerged as complex phenomena. Therefore, we abstracted these new challenges and analyzed them as separate themes. For example, one participant described how they often recorded their drug use in a tracking app before consumption, and how the app's feature of providing warnings for potentially dangerous combinations led them to believe that the absence of a warning meant their actions were safe, prompting them not to conduct further research. We coded this risk as *Overdependence on IT*. These challenges included information redundancy, over-reliance on automated safety testing, increased engagement in risky behaviors, and the potential for financial loss in online drug purchases. We recognized that these challenges were not confined to specific behaviors but were pervasive across multiple aspects of IT usage.
