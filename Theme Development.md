In the process of deriving themes, we first identified five primary IT usage behaviors among PWUD, analyzed their safety impacts, abstracted new safety challenges as broader phenomena, and then used these insights to answer our research questions.

We began by examining how PWUD utilize IT. Through a systematic analysis, we identified five primary behaviors that PWUD engage in while using IT: 1) searching for drug-related information, 2) asking questions about drug use, 3) making drug deals, 4) sharing experiences and engaging in discussions, and 5) recording drug use. These behaviors formed the foundational framework for our study.

Following this, we analyzed the impact of these behaviors on participants' safety whenever they mentioned engaging in these activities. Each behavior was further explored to understand its specific safety implications, resulting in sub-themes that addressed various dimensions such as physical safety, mental health, and privacy. For instance, when participants described using IT to search for drug information, we focused on how this behavior influenced their acute reactions and long-term health. 

During this analysis, we discovered that certain new safety challenges could not be easily linked to a single behavior but rather emerged as complex phenomena. Therefore, we abstracted these new challenges and analyzed them as separate themes. These challenges included information redundancy, over-reliance on automated safety testing, increased engagement in risky behaviors, and the potential for financial loss in online drug purchases. We recognized that these challenges were not confined to specific behaviors but were pervasive across multiple aspects of IT usage.
